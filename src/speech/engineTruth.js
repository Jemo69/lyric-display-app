/**
 * engineTruth.js — is the engine that is actually running real?
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The engine shipped in this PR is `fakeEngine.js`: a
 * contract-conformant stand-in that ignores the audio bytes and replays a
 * canned sentence, because the native whisper.cpp binding does not exist yet.
 * It reports `backend: 'fake'` in its health payload, and that value travels
 * all the way to the renderer (`fakeEngine.js` -> `main/speechEngine.js`
 * `buildHealthPayload` -> `speech:health` IPC) — where it was never read.
 *
 * So the UI showed a green ON badge, "Local · large-v3", a "Listening" chip and
 * an install wizard saying "Ready to transcribe with Large v3", attached to a
 * process emitting a string it wrote itself. For a church operator that is
 * worse than a broken feature: it is a feature that confidently reports
 * transcribing a sermon while doing nothing of the kind. `large-v3` also
 * advertises `wordTimestamps` and `biasSupport`, which enables all three
 * suggestion lanes, so a stray tap could put canned text on the sanctuary
 * screens.
 *
 * The rule this module encodes is simple and deliberately blunt: **canned
 * output may never look like transcription.** Anything derived from a fake
 * backend is labelled as such wherever it is shown, and is never eligible to
 * become a sendable suggestion.
 *
 * Pure functions, no I/O, no store access, no imports — so importing this
 * performs nothing (invariant 4: off by default, cold by default).

 * silently reclassify the real engine as canned for every later caller in the
 * process. A frozen array is genuinely immutable.
