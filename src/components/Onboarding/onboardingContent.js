const APP_CONTEXT = `Selah is a free, local-first worship & live-event display app (Electron + web). Core model:
- A control panel (this screen) stages content; outputs are separate browser-source URLs (/output1, /output2, /stage, plus custom outputs like /lower-third) consumed by OBS/vMix/projectors.
- Three content modes: SONGS (lyric slides, .txt/.lrc/.pro/.sng with timestamps, sections, chords), BIBLE (imported translations .xml/.json, passage picker, verse slides, parallel dual-translation, versification offsets), FREE NOTES (announcements/sermon points).
- Explicit live declaration: an amber Song/Bible pill applies per-mode output templates; the app never auto-switches styling.
- Show states: LIVE / CLEAR / BLACKOUT / LOGO dock; master output toggle; announcement ticker queue.
- Planning: setlists (.ldset), timed run-sheets (.ldsch) with auto-advance, setlist prev/next navigation.
- Automation: autoplay (timed), intelligent autoplay (audio-follow), HTTP actions per slide (lighting/ATEM), MIDI/OSC triggers, metronome, sermon-assist speech captions.
- Styling: per-output fonts/colors/backgrounds, saved templates, stage return with next-line preview.`;
