# speech-engine — LyricDisplay Live Sermon Assist, Phase 2 scaffold

A **self-contained, zero-dependency** implementation of the v1 speech-engine
contract (`shared/speech/protocol.js`) that LyricDisplay's main process talks
to over loopback HTTP.

## What this is

- A `node:http` server implementing the contract routes: `/v1/health`,
  `/v1/models`, `/v1/session`, `/v1/session/:id/close`, `/v1/transcribe`,
  plus `501 not-implemented` placeholders for model download/delete and
  benchmark (those phases come later).
- A **`--engine=fake` mode (the default)** that serves the contract from
  canned data. It emits real, schema-validated `ready` / `partial` /
  `final` / `stats` messages so the whole app side — supervisor, health
  poll, IPC surface, renderer — can be exercised end to end with **no
  model, no binary, no download**.
- Its own tests, run by Node's built-in test runner.

## What this is NOT

- **No weights ship.** There is no `models/` content in git (the directory
  is gitignored along with every weight extension), no `npm install`
  step, and no runtime dependencies at all. `dependencies` in
  `package.json` is `{}` on purpose.
- **No native whisper.cpp binary.** The `--engine=whisper` path is not
  wired yet: selecting it exits with a clear message and a non-zero code.
  Binding a real whisper.cpp binary is a later, machine-verified
  follow-up — nothing in this repository requires it to pass its tests.

## Security properties (enforced, not convention)

| Rule | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Binds `127.0.0.1` (loopback) **only** — non-loopback host throws | `assertLoopbackBindHost()` in `server.js`, checked at construction AND `listen()` |
| `Origin` must be in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (or absent, i.e. a non-browser client) | request handler, before any route |
| `x-ld-speech-token` required on every request (401 missing / 403 wrong, timing-safe compare) | request handler; the CORS preflight is origin-checked but token-less by browser design |
| Never logs tokens, audio, or transcript text | no logging of payloads anywhere in this package |

## Running tests

From the **repository root**:

```sh
node --test speech-engine/
```

or from inside this package:

```sh
cd speech-engine && npm test   # runs `node --test`
```

No setup, no install, no network.

> Note: Node's test runner treats a positional path as a literal program
> entry (directories resolve through `package.json` `main`), so this
> package's `main` deliberately points at `test.entry.js`, which imports
> the three test files. That makes `node --test speech-engine/` execute
> the whole suite (31 tests) instead of booting the HTTP server.
> `npm test` (`node --test test/*.test.js`) runs the same files
> directly. `npm start` (`node index.js`) still starts the engine.

## Transport decision (Phase 2)

The v1 plan's renderer↔engine transport is WebSocket. Adding `ws` would cost
a dependency, which invariant 2 forbids, so **Phase 2 ships HTTP only**.
Message-emission code is routed through a single seam — `bus.js` — so the
WebSocket transport drops in later as `bus.subscribe(wsSink)` without
touching engine logic. Until then `index.js` subscribes a parent-process
mirror that forwards messages over the fork IPC channel to LyricDisplay's
supervisor, which relays them to the renderer over `speech:*` IPC channels.

## Layout

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `index.js` | CLI entry: args/env, fake-vs-whisper mode, listen, fork-IPC handshake |
| `server.js` | HTTP server: origin/token gates, route table, loopback enforcement |
| `fakeEngine.js` | canned engine: sessions, canned segment, canned metrics |
| `bus.js` | message-emission seam + schema validation (`validateMessage`) |
| `test/` | `node --test` suite (not picked up by the app's vitest run) |

The contract is imported from `../shared/speech/protocol.js` by relative
path — this is a separate package and does not use the app's Vite aliases.
