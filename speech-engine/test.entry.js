/**
 * test.entry.js — the package's test entry point.
 *
 * Node's test runner treats a positional path as a literal program
 * entry: a directory resolves through package.json "main". Pointing
 * `main` here makes `node --test speech-engine/` (from the repo
 * root) execute the whole suite in one process.
 *
 * The name deliberately does NOT match the runner's discovery
 * patterns (*.test.js, test-*.js, *-test.js, *_test.js, test.js),
 * so `npm test` (bare `node --test`, which discovers every file
 * under test/) runs each test file exactly once — never twice.
 *
 * No setup, no fixtures: importing a test file registers its tests
 * with this process's root test harness.
