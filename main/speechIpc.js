/**
 * main/speechIpc.js — Live Sermon Assist Phase 2: the renderer-facing IPC
 * surface for Sermon Assist.
 *
 * Mirrors the structure and idioms of preload.js (namespaced object, plain
 * channel strings) and keeps every Electron touchpoint in one file so
 * main/speechEngine.js stays electron-free and unit-testable.
 *
 * The channel inventory below IS the contract with the renderer; it is
 * pinned deliberately by tests/speech/invariants.test.js (invariant 4), so
 * adding or renaming a channel is a visible, reviewed diff in BOTH files.
 *
 * LIVE vs STUB (Phase 2):
 *   live  speech:start, speech:stop, speech:get-state, speech:install (the
 *         resumable model downloader in main/speechDownloader.js — progress
 *         streams on speech:progress and install state republishes on
 *         speech:install-state), speech:select-model (digest-verifies the
 *         installed file before it becomes the active model), and every
 *         event broadcast below whose source exists today (status, health,
 *         transcript relay, error, install-state).
 *   live  speech:benchmark (Phase 3) and speech:uninstall (Phase 6).
 *   stub  none. Both stubs returned a real, documented shape — { ok:false,
 *         code:'not-implemented', ... } — with validated argument shapes, so
 *         the phases that filled them in filled in behaviour rather than
 *         inventing channels.
 *   queued speech:progress is emitted by the downloader and by the benchmark.
 *
 * HISTORY (Decision D9, Phase 4): the six speech:history:* invokes below
 * are the transcript-history surface — list/get/search/export/erase for the
 * renderer. The WRITE path is the supervisor itself: every speech:start
 * forwards the shared history store (see `start` below), so the
 * supervisor's session recorder (main/speechEngine.js) writes the same
 * directory these handlers read; `append` keeps the path reachable and
 * testable directly.
 * Every history reply is built by main/speechHistory.js, whose summaries
 * carry NO segment text except where the renderer asked for it (get,
 * search excerpts).
 *
 * Hygiene (plan): never log or broadcast tokens, audio, sample values, or
 * transcript text. Engine messages are relayed whole (the renderer needs
 * the text) but logged by TYPE only. Download results are logged by CODE
 * with the catalog file name only — never absolute paths. History
 * operations are logged by COUNT, session id, and BYTE total only.
