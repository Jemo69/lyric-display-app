/**
 * main/speechEngineDiagnostics.js — can the installed whisper.cpp binary
 * actually START on this machine?
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `hasEngineBinary()` answers "is there a file named
 * whisper-cli(.exe) with a non-zero size". That is not the same question as
 * "can the operating system run it", and the gap is not theoretical: the
 * official whisper.cpp Windows archive is dynamically linked against
 * MSVCP140.dll, VCRUNTIME140.dll and VCRUNTIME140_1.dll, none of which ship
 * in the zip. On a machine without the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable,
 * the file is present and the process dies before `main()` with
 * STATUS_DLL_NOT_FOUND (0xC0000135). Every segment then fails, the engine
 * emits `transcribe-failed`, and — until this probe — the operator saw an
 * empty transcript and a rail that said "listening".
 *
 * So the check is deliberately a real spawn (`whisper-cli --help`), not a
 * file test. It costs a few milliseconds, it exercises the loader, and it is
 * the only way to tell "installed" from "runnable".
 *
 * WHAT THIS NEVER DOES: it does not read audio, does not load a model, does
 * not print a transcript, and does not touch the network. The only output it
 * inspects is the usage text a CLI prints for `--help`.
